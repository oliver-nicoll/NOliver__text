## Test Instructions

    Language: JavaScript

    #1 Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.

    #2 Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.

    #3 If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be? 
        Brief Explanation: One thing I would change from React/Redux Toolkit, my favorite platform, would be how the store becomes the haystack
        and the bug/ problem you are trying locating becomes the needle when in a very large scale app. I wrote a blog post as my response, please check it out!
